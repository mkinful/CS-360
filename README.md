The application I designed was created keeping the needs of users in mind for smooth registration, login functionality, and SMS notification. Its goal is to facilitate users' work by ensuring their actions are simplified and their feedback at all times via an SMS system that is supposed to be very helpful in following up on items in inventory, happenings, or even body weight on a daily basis. The system was intended to target users who want fast and secure access to their accounts and immediate notification.

Key screens for the described user needs included the login, registration screens, and backend supporting the sending of SMS notifications. This UI has been designed with a view toward simplicity and ease of use, from simple input fields to buttons that allow users to interact with the app. In every instance, the UI design considered ensuring that whatever the user clicked took them to some other part of the app without any confusion feelings, thus leading to a clean layout with few distractions. This kept the designs simple yet engaging for users, as it was easy and quick for them to meet their objectives while going through them.

In writing the app's code, I will co-op each of its features into smaller pieces that can be manageable; for instance, SMS notification and login. Some of the best practices, such as inline commenting, separating concerns into other classes, allowed me to maintain cleanliness of the code and maintainability. Such tips can be carried on in future projects for maintaining organization with scalability.

I tested the running of the application on an emulator and on a physical device to test whether all the features were working properly. This stage of testing was quite crucial because it showed minor bugs that were present in handling the permissions, hence allowed me to tune the application well for better user experience. Testing definitely ensures functional code for reliability in the delivered product.

One of the biggest challenges throughout design and development was the feature of SMS notifications with smooth permissions handling. I had to be innovative in smoothing the way permissions would be requested, making sure that users are well-informed and that this app also does not overreach in its requests. Regarding success, I was most effective at integrating the functionality of SMS, demonstrating deep understanding of permission handling, user interface design, and backend integration, proving how technical and design skills can be combined to meet user needs.
